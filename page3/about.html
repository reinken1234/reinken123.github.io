            <h1> Captain Otoyo's  sneezy headline # revelation. </h1>
            <p> An attempt to create the Super League is the most ridiculous thing that has ever happened 
                in football. Racism is the one thing that i have never understood how it is still happening
                in the current world.Like come on dude, we are all the same before God's presence. With Wakenya FC 
                such actions are condemned. We cannot allow nourishment of such things and therefore a condusive 
                environment is created to tackle such  issues.
